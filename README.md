# GYST - Git Your Source Tracked

A lightweight, custom implementation of Git version control system built from scratch to understand the fundamentals of how Git works under the hood.

## 🚀 What is GYST?

GYST (pronounced "gist") is a simplified version control system that implements core Git functionality. This project was created as a learning exercise to deeply understand how Git manages repositories, tracks changes, and handles version control operations.

## ✨ Features

- **Repository Management**: Initialize new repositories
- **File Staging**: Add files to the staging area
- **Commit System**: Create commits with messages
- **Repository Cloning**: Clone existing repositories
- **History Tracking**: View commit history
- **Diff Functionality**: Compare changes between commits

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

GYST can be run directly using npx without installation:

### Initialize a Repository
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git init
```

### Add Files to Staging
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git add <filename>
```

### Commit Changes
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git commit "Your commit message"
```

### Clone a Repository
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git clone <repository-url>
```

### View Commit History
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git log
```

### View Differences
```bash
npx https://github.com/Abuhurera00/gyst.git diff <commit-hash>
```
